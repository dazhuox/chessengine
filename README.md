## Introduction

Welcome to our Chess Game project! This project aims to provide a simple yet engaging chess-playing experience. It was developed by Da Zhuo Xie, Corey Zhao, Julien Bergeron, and Tong Maxime Wu.

This project has been developed through the 13th edition of CodeJam, which is the first hackathon for every individual on the team.

## Features

- Classic chess gameplay
- Pygame-based GUI
- Engine able to play at a depth of 5 for blitz and a depth of 6 for higher time controls (speed factor)
- Engine has 3 levels of difficulties, easy, intermediate, and hard. Estimated at 600, 1400, and 1800 elo rating respectively (not tested).

## Getting Started

To get started with our Chess Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone our repository.
2. Run the app.py file in the IDE for the engine
3. Run the chess_ui.py file for the pygame. You can get to the repo here: https://github.com/coreyzhao/chess_ui

## Pygame Installation

Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. You can install Pygame using:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
##Technologies Used
We used Python for the algorithm, then attempted to use Flask, html, and javascript to get a frontend of the program.
We also had to use the pygame library to make the runnable game.

##Acknoledgements
We inspired our project upon many resources, such as:
